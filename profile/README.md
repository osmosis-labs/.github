## Osmosis-Labs

The Osmosis-labs hosts a series of repositories relating to the Osmosis blockchain and tooling for Cosmos.

The Osmosis blockchain is a decentralized network, ran by 100+ validators and full nodes, with many front-ends and development teams on it.

Docs for the network can be found at docs.osmosis.zone. Some repositories of interest:

## State machine

* [osmosis](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis) - A node implementation for the Osmosis chain
* [cosmos-sdk fork](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/cosmos-sdk) - Fork of the Cosmos SDK used in osmosis
